# list-metrics

## Description

This command just uses the [general options](/cmd/). It connects to the
vCenter and fetches a list of
[PerfCounterInfos](https://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/bf660c0a-f060-46e8-a94d-4b5e6ffc77ad/208bc706-e281-49b6-a0ce-b402ec19ef82/SDK/vsphere-ws/docs/ReferenceGuide/vim.PerformanceManager.html#field_detail)
and displays them to you, so you can make use of them with the
[perf](/cmd/perf) command.
